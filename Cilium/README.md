# Cilium tutorial
 
this is  a Cilium learning tutorial， maybe I should set up a brand new repo, but i don't think i have much time spending on Cilium project, so it's a sub dir for now.

`sudo mount bpffs -t bpf /sys/fs/bpf`
安装Cilium
`kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/1.7.2/install/kubernetes/quick-install.yaml`
